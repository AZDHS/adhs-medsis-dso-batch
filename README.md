# Splitting one SAS dataset into many

# Overview
This SAS code can be used to split one dataset into smaller datasets based on a maximum row per dataset requirement

Context: Arizona's statewide public health surveillance system requires batch files that are 300 rows or less. We use this SAS program to split our larger datasets into smaller datasets, each with 300 or less rows.
